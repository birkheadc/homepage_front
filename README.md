## **BirkheadC's Homepage**

The latest version of my homepage. Written with React and Typescript.

# Focus

For this project, I am focusing on the following areas.

## TypeScript

## Documentation

As with my ProjectsWebApi application, I am focusing on documentation.

Writing good documentation, comments, build instructions etc. has helped me get back into my own code after switching computers, or otherwise not working on the project for extended periods of time.

I intend to continue treating the non-code in my code with the same importance going forward.

# About the Code

## **Node** and **Packages**

I found some strange problems using certain versions of Node, and eventually settled on using v14.20.0 for this project. Using Node Version Manager makes it easy to swap between Node versions, so running `nvm use 14` before anything else made everything work smoothly for me.

This app was created first via **create-react-app**. Simply run `npx create-react-app` in the directory to build the app in.

Navigation uses **react-router-dom**, which can be installed via `npm install react-router-dom`
