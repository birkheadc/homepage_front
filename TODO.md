# TODO

- Look into HashLink `react-router-hash-link` for building links that move to certain parts of a page rather than just to the top of that page. My last homepage used them, but:
    - I'm not sure if this build will need them
    - Something went wrong when I tried to install the package

- Does NavLink have some sort of `activeClass` / `nonActiveClass` like I'm seeing on the HashLink page? That would make it really easy to, say, highlight the page I'm currently on. On my other app I'm using javascript to do that...

- Figure out how to do a light / dark theme with a different color scheme and different background image.

- Make sure the background image looks nice in mobile.

- Set up the mobile version of the navbar.
