# TODO

- Look into HashLink `react-router-hash-link` for building links that move to certain parts of a page rather than just to the top of that page. My last homepage used them, but:
    - I'm not sure if this build will need them
    - Something went wrong when I tried to install the package

- Make sure the background image looks nice in mobile.

- Set up the mobile version of the navbar.

- Look into whether the facebook link I am using is the link I should be using

- Write each page's content.

- Build the api for blog, projects, and activity feed.

- Add japanese fonts

- Build LOADING screen

- In ProjectsPreview.tsx, when technologies overflows the box, I want it to scroll!
