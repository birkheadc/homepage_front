# TODO

- Look into HashLink `react-router-hash-link` for building links that move to certain parts of a page rather than just to the top of that page. My last homepage used them, but:
    - I'm not sure if this build will need them
    - Something went wrong when I tried to install the package

- Write each page's content.

- Build the api for blog and activity feed.

- Add japanese fonts

- In ProjectsPreview.tsx, when technologies overflows the box, I want it to scroll!

- Add link to resume on resume page, maybe automatically generate the resume when the app is built?
